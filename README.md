Bash Hints


## Make terminal show the command running as title
Add these two lines (in this order) to the bottom of ~/.bashrc
```bash
PS1="\033]0;\w\007${PS1}"
trap 'echo -ne "\033]0;$BASH_COMMAND\007" > /dev/stderr' DEBUG
```


## Make terminal show the command running as title (path + command)
Add these lines to the bottom of ~/.bashrc
```bash
# Make terminal show the command running as title
# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
case "$TERM" in
xterm*|rxvt*)
    PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${USER}@${HOSTNAME}: ${PWD}\007"'

    # Show the currently running command in the terminal title:
    # http://www.davidpashley.com/articles/xterm-titles-with-bash.html
    show_command_in_title_bar()
    {
        case "$BASH_COMMAND" in
            *\033]0*)
                # The command is trying to set the title bar as well;
                # this is most likely the execution of $PROMPT_COMMAND.
                # In any case nested escapes confuse the terminal, so don't
                # output them.
                ;;
            *)
                echo -ne "\033]0;${PWD} > ${BASH_COMMAND}\007"
                ;;
        esac
    }
    trap show_command_in_title_bar DEBUG
    ;;
*)
    ;;
esac
```

## Automatically get different terminal colors each time open terminal
```bash
# Change color according to the number of Bash shells opened
# Creates the .Bash_Color_Changer file if it's not present
if ! [ -f ~/.Bash_Color_Changer ]; then
    echo ORIGINAL > ~/.Bash_Color_Changer
fi

# Array holding the name of the profiles: Substitute it for the names you're using
Color_counter=(Profile1 Profile2 Profile3)
# Finds out the number of opened bashs counting the lines containing "bash"
# in the pstree function. (-c deactivates compact display to avoid it showing
# lines with "2*[bash]" instead of one for each bash)
Number_of_bashs=$(($(pstree -c | grep "bash" | wc -l)-1))

# Checks if the terminal being opened was opened by the user or by
# the script, and act according to it
if [ $(cat ~/.Bash_Color_Changer) = ORIGINAL ]; then 
    if ((Number_of_bashs < ${#Color_counter[*]})); then
        echo COPY > ~/.Bash_Color_Changer
        gnome-terminal --tab-with-profile-internal-id=${Color_counter[${Number_of_bashs}]} 
        exit
    fi
else 
    echo ORIGINAL > ~/.Bash_Color_Changer
fi
```
